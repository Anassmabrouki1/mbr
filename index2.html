    <h1>MBR</h1>
    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>Hello, my name is Anass Mabrouki. I'm 20 years old and I study at EST (Higher School of Technology). This is my first professional website, which I created using HTML, CSS, PHP, and MySQL. I call it MBR.

        This website is dedicated to football, and the goal is to provide comprehensive information about players and clubs. Often, when searching for information about a player, you can't find all the details you need. That's why I designed this website to offer full information about players, including their height, first club, agent, parents, and more.
        
        The website is still in development, so for now, it may not include a lot of players. Thank you for visiting my website. I hope MBR meets your expectations </p>
